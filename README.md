# Server Monitor Bot üêß

Lightweight Telegram bot to monitor and manage a Linux server. Provides system info, live stats charts, shell/python exec utilities and update/restart integration via systemd.

## Commands
(All commands except `/start` are owner-restricted, set `OWNER_ID` to your numeric Telegram id.)

- `/start` ‚Äî Welcome message
- `/help` ‚Äî Show available commands (owner-only)
- `/info` ‚Äî System info (neofetch-like)
- `/info -ip` ‚Äî System info + public IP
- `/cputemp` ‚Äî CPU temperature on supported hardware (e.g., Raspberry Pi).
- `/stats` ‚Äî Static chart of CPU / RAM / Disk
- `/stats -live` ‚Äî Live monitoring (10 updates)
- `/ping` ‚Äî Measure Telegram API latency and uptime
- `/ip` ‚Äî Show server public IP
- `/shell` <cmd...> ‚Äî Run shell command on server
- `/pyexec` <python code> ‚Äî Execute Python snippet remotely
- `/updatebot` ‚Äî Git pull and restart systemd service

## Prerequisites
- Python 3.9+ (3.10 recommended)
- System packages for building wheels if needed (build-essential, libffi-dev, etc.)
- A Telegram bot token and your Telegram numeric user id

## Install & run (local)
```bash
python3 -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate
pip install --upgrade pip
pip install -r requirements.txt

export BOT_TOKEN="123:ABC..."
export OWNER_ID="123456789"
export OWNER_USERNAME="myuser"
python3 bot.py
```

## Run as a systemd service (recommended)
1. Copy and edit the template file `server-monitor-bot/server-monitor-bot.service`
2. Set `User`,`WorkingDirectory`, `ExecStart`, and environment vars (`BOT_TOKEN`, `OWNER_ID`, `OWNER_USERNAME`).
3. Install and enable:

```bash
sudo cp server-monitor-bot.service /etc/systemd/system/server-monitor-bot.service
sudo systemctl daemon-reload
sudo systemctl enable --now server-monitor-bot.service
sudo systemctl status server-monitor-bot.service
```

To view logs:
```bash
journalctl -u server-monitor-bot.service -f
```

## Security notes
- `/shell` and `/pyexec` allow arbitrary code execution ‚Äî use only in trusted environments.
- Owner-only decorator enforces `OWNER_ID`; ensure `OWNER_ID` is set correctly.
- Review and adapt the systemd unit for additional hardening as needed.
